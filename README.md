# evolution
A genetic evolution simulation

## the time 
- the time goes by cycle 
- time start (zero time) at 0 to infinite ...
- each time cycle (or cycle) is running identical

## the world or the Cube (notice the uppercase)
- the Cube is the location where simulated life take place
- the Cube is composed of 1000x1000x1000 small cubes or cubes(lowercase)
- the cube have direction north,south,east,west,top,bottom
- each cycle the top of the Cube drop light (photons) as energy for life

## a cube 
- a cube may contain  a cell and only one
- a cube not containing a cell is empty
- at (zero time) all the cubes are empty (no life)
- a cube has a location expressed in longitude,latitude,altitude (or lon,lat,alt in that order)

## a photon

## a cell
- a cell is a component of a XXX living being 
- a cell is in a cube therefore has a location
- a cell has a genome
- each cycle the cell execute his genome code
- each cell absorbs the photons that fall on it for a cycle
- a cell consumes one photon per cycle
- a cell may store a maximum of 20 photons
- a cell with 0 photons during 3 cycles die (disappear)
- a cell may transfert photons to their neighbour in all directions depending on its genome
- a cell may duplicate  itselfs in all directions depending on its genome

## a genome

## a XXX
